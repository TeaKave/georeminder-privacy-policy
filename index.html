      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: November 17, 2025</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Short version:</strong> GeoReminder uses your device’s location to trigger reminders near places you care about. Your data is stored locally on your device and is not sent to my own servers. Some third-party services (such as map providers) may process data as part of their normal operation.
      </div>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how GeoReminder (the “App”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the App on your Android device.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Controller & Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, you can contact me at:
      </p>
      <p>
        Email:
        <a href="mailto:mark.nagy.dev+georeminder@gmail.com">mark.nagy.dev+georeminder@gmail.com</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies only to the GeoReminder Android application. It does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or integrated with the App.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Information I Collect</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Location Data</h3>
      <p>
        GeoReminder relies on your device’s location to provide core functionality such as geofencing and location-based reminders.
      </p>
      <p>The App may collect and use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise location data</strong> (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile network information).</li>
        <li>Location information <strong>in the background</strong>, even when the App is not open, in order to detect when you enter or leave defined geographic areas (geofences).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This location data is processed <strong>only locally on your device</strong> to trigger reminders and manage your locations. It is <strong>not sent to my own servers or stored on any backend controlled by me</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Personal Identifiers</h3>
      <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account or sign in. I do <strong>not</strong> collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address (except when you contact me directly by email)</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>
        <li>Any other personally identifying account information within the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Device Data</h3>
      <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect device identifiers (such as Android ID or Advertising ID) for its core functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Usage Data, Analytics & Crash Reports</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to use third-party services (such as Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics) to help understand how the App is used and to improve stability and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When enabled, these services may collect anonymized or pseudonymized information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic device information (device model, OS version)</li>
        <li>App version and usage patterns (e.g., which screens are viewed)</li>
        <li>Crash reports and error information</li>
        <li>Approximate usage times</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used purely to diagnose issues and improve the App. It is not used to personally identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How Your Information Is Stored</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All reminder data, locations, and configuration settings are stored
          <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I do <strong>not</strong> operate my own servers for storing your personal or location data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If third-party services (like Firebase) are enabled, they may store certain usage and crash data on their own infrastructure according to their respective privacy policies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        GeoReminder uses or may use the following third-party services:
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Google Maps & Android Location Services</h3>
      <p>
        The App may use Google services to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Display maps</li>
        <li>Access device location</li>
        <li>Handle geofencing and location updates</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services are provided by Google and are subject to Google’s own terms of service and privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 MapTiler</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses MapTiler services for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location search</li>
        <li>Reverse geocoding (turning coordinates into place names/addresses)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you search for a place or your location is converted into a readable address, some data (such as coordinates or search queries) may be sent to MapTiler’s servers. This is subject to MapTiler’s own privacy policy and terms.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Firebase (Planned)</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to use the following Firebase services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – to understand general usage trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – to receive crash reports and improve app stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services are provided by Google and process data according to Google’s privacy policy. If these services are introduced or their use changes significantly, I will update this Privacy Policy as appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> currently use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising SDKs</li>
        <li>Third-party attribution services such as AppsFlyer or Mixpanel</li>
        <li>Subscription/payment SDKs (e.g., RevenueCat)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        I do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your data to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>Your information may be shared only in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services listed above (e.g., MapTiler, Google/Firebase) may process data as part of providing their services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, court order, or governmental authority, I may be obligated to disclose certain information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        GeoReminder is intended for the general public and is <strong>not specifically designed</strong> for children under the age of 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App does not require registration and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information, please contact me so I can take appropriate steps.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All reminder and location data used by the App is stored locally on your device and remains there until you delete it or uninstall the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uninstalling the App</strong> removes the App and its locally stored data from your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          If third-party services (such as Firebase) are used, they may retain certain anonymized usage or crash data for a limited period, according to their own policies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have questions about data deletion beyond uninstalling the App, you can contact me at
        <a href="mailto:mark.nagy.dev+georeminder@gmail.com">mark.nagy.dev+georeminder@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data, such as the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access information about what data is processed</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
        <li>Request deletion of information where applicable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because GeoReminder stores your reminder data locally and does not operate its own backend, many of these rights can be exercised directly by you on your device (for example, by editing or deleting reminders or uninstalling the App). For anything else, feel free to contact me.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        I take reasonable measures to protect your data within the App. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Since your reminder and location data are stored on your device, the security of your device (screen lock, OS updates, etc.) also plays an important role.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when adding new features or integrating new third-party services.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I make changes, I will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Significant changes may also be communicated within the App where appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you continue to use GeoReminder after changes to this Privacy Policy take effect, you agree to the revised policy.
      </p>
